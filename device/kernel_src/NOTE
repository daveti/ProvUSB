The example .config and .config.old are also provided here as modifying the defconfig from Yocto may not work!
To hack the .config for the Yocto kernel build, go to:
yocto/build/tmp/work/overo-poky-linux-gnueabi/linux-gumstix/3.5.7-r0/linux-overo-standard-build
where you will find .config and .config.old.
